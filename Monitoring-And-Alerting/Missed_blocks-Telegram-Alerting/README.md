This type of alerting does not collect private data, so if the server on which the [missed-blocks-checker](https://github.com/solarlabsteam/missed-blocks-checker) is installed will be hacked, then the attacker will not receive logs from servers with validators.  

‚ÅâÔ∏è If machine logs are not collected, then how does alerting get information about validators?
- **gRPC node address to get signing info and validators info from, defaults to `localhost:9090`**. By default, nodes are installed with an open gRPC port, so it will most likely be possible to prescribe the seeds and peers commands or any node from the addrbook, since if the node is intended to work on a public network, then why would its owner disable gRPC.
- **Tendermint RPC node to get block info from. Defaults to `http://localhost:26657`**. In the same way, you can write the seeds and peers of the command or any node from the addrbook project.

ü§î Where is the best place to install this alerting software?  
- **As usual, the best option is a separate server.**
## Overview
In this tutorial, we will install and setup [missed-blocks-checker](https://github.com/solarlabsteam/missed-blocks-checker):
- Prepare the server for missed-blocks-checker
- Installing
- Setup service file
- Configure the Alerting by `config.toml`
- Start Service
- Setup Notifications in Telegram 
## Prepare the server for missed-blocks-checker
Update
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install make git jq curl gcc g++ mc nano -y
```
Install go
```
wget -O go1.18.linux-amd64.tar.gz https://go.dev/dl/go1.18.linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.18.linux-amd64.tar.gz && rm go1.18.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cat <<'EOF' >> $HOME/.bash_profile
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GO111MODULE=on
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin
EOF
. $HOME/.bash_profile
cp /usr/local/go/bin/go /usr/bin
go version
```
Setup [Server protection](https://github.com/AlexToTheSun/Validator_Activity/blob/main/Mainnet-Guides/Minimum-server-protection.md)
## Installing
clone the repo and build it. This will generate a ./main binary file in the repository folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/solarlabsteam/missed-blocks-checker
cd missed-blocks-checker
go build
```
For running in the background we have to copy the file to the system apps folder:
```
sudo cp ./missed-blocks-checker /usr/local/bin
```

## Setup service file
Create a systemd service for missed-blocks-checker:
```
sudo tee <<EOF >/dev/null /etc/systemd/system/missed-blocks-checker.service
[Unit]
Description=Missed Blocks Checker
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
TimeoutStartSec=0
CPUWeight=95
IOWeight=95
ExecStart=missed-blocks-checker --config <config path>
Restart=always
RestartSec=2
LimitNOFILE=800000
KillSignal=SIGTERM

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```
Where:
- `<config path>` - the path to the config file we need

Add this service to the autostart and run it and check the logs:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable missed-blocks-checker
sudo systemctl start missed-blocks-checker
sudo systemctl status missed-blocks-checker
journalctl -u missed-blocks-checker -f --output cat
```
